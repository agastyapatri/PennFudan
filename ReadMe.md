# **Object Detection**
_This project is an implementation of the key ideas that enable Object Detection. There are a few standard algorithms which will be tested. I've started this endeavour as an Object Detection counterpart to the purpose that the  MNIST Image Classification task serves. Any further experimentation with object detection algorithms will be done here._


## **Introduction**
I will be focusing on the implementation of the members of the families of three main Object Detection Algorithms:
1. Single Shot Multibox Detectors (SSD)
2. YOLOv3
3. Fast(er) R-CNN (FRCNN)

The /figures-results diretory also contains the config files which have the parameters for the network. 

### _**Single Shot Multibox Detection**_
The model consists of a base network followed by several multiscale feature map blocks. The base network extracts features from the image and for this purpose, VGG16 is used [3].



### _**You Only Look Once**_
A single stage object detection paradigm. 

### _**R-CNN**_
